\section{Linear Dependence and Independence}
First let's review the definitions of linear dependence and independence\cite{lay}:
    \begin{definition}
    An indexed set of vectors $\left\{v_1, v_2, \dots v_i\right\}$ in ${\mathbb{R}}^n$ is said to be \textbf{linearly independent} if $\alpha_1 \cdot v_1 + \alpha_2 \cdot v_2 \dots + \alpha_i \cdot v_i = 0$ has only the trivial solution, where all $\alpha_i \in \mathbb{Z}$.
    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}
    An indexed set of vectors $\left\{v_1, v_2, \dots v_n\right\}$ in ${\mathbb{R}}^n$ is said to be \textbf{linearly dependent} if there exists a $\alpha_1 \dots \alpha_i$, not all zero, that satisfies $\alpha_1 \cdot v_1 + \alpha_2 \cdot v_2 \dots + \alpha_i \cdot v_i = 0$, where all $\alpha_i \in \mathbb{Z}$.
    \end{definition}

\subsection{Proof of Sine and Cosine's Linear Independence}
\textbf{Claim. } $a \cdot \sin(x) + b \cdot \cos(x) = 0$ is linearly independent.
    \begin{proof}
        Using the definition of linear independence, we will show that $a$ and $b$ must be zero for all $x$ in the interval $[0, 2\pi]$.
        
        \vspace{0.15cm}
        \noindent\ignorespacesafterend
        We can find $a$ by setting $x = \frac{\pi}{2}$:
        \begin{align*}
            a \cdot \cancelto{1}{\sin \bigg(\frac{\pi}{2} \bigg)}
            + b \cdot \cancelto{0}{\cos \bigg(\frac{\pi}{2} \bigg)} &= 0\\
            a &= 0
        \end{align*}
        Next, we can find $b$ by setting $x = 0$:
        \begin{align*}
            a \cdot \cancelto{0}{\sin \big(0 \big)}
            + b \cdot \cancelto{1}{\cos \big(0 \big)} &= 0\\
            b &= 0
        \end{align*}
        \noindent
        Since sine and cosine are periodic, it follows that $a$ and $b$ must be $0$ for all $x$ in $(-\infty, \infty)$.  Thus, the claim holds.\\
    \end{proof}
