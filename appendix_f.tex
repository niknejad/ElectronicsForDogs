    \end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vspace{0.5cm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \textbf{Drift} - Charged-particle motion in response to an applied electric-field.
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \vspace{0.15cm}
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \begin{itemize}
        \setlength\itemsep{0.5em}
        \item{Because of collisions with ionized impurity atoms and thermally agitated lattice atoms, carrier acceleration is frequently interrupted and said to be scattered.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vspace{0.5cm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \textbf{Drift Current} - When an electric field is applied across a semiconductor, the resulting force on the carriers tends to accelerate the $+q$ charged holes in the direction of the electric field, and the $-q$ charged electrons in the direction opposite the electric field.

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \begin{itemize}
        \setlength\itemsep{0.5em}
        \item{A greater reverse bias across the collector–base junction, for example, increases the collector–base depletion width, thereby decreasing the width of the charge carrier portion of the base.}

\noindent
    \textbf{Effective Mass} - The apparent mass of electrons and holes inside of the crystal structure of a semiconductor, which is different from the mass of electrons within a vacuum due to the atomic structure of the semiconductor crystal, and how the atoms interact with each other inside of it.
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \begin{itemize}
        \setlength\itemsep{0.5em}
        \item{Inside the crystal electrons will collide with the semiconductor atoms, which causes a periodic negative acceleration of the carriers. In addition to this, electrons inside of the semiconductor crystal are also subject to complex crystalline fields in addition to the electric field.}
        \item{The motion of carriers inside a semiconductor crystal is a quantum mechanical phenomenon, because the electrons moving through a solid experience a specific potential energy which dictates the mass of a wave associated with the electron.  This is why assigning an effective mass allows us to treat electrons and holes as quasi-classical particles and use classical particle relationships in most analyses.}
        \item{The effective mass is a result of electron interaction with the lattice (phonons).  Holes spend more time interacting with phonons because they have a smaller velocity than electrons.  This results in holes usually having a larger effective mass.}
        \item{The effective mass depends on the effective potential the electron or hole feels when moving through the lattice.  The potential seen by the electrons and the holes is different, and this is why they have different effective masses.}

    \textbf{Einstein Relation} - For a particle with electrical charge $q$, its electrical mobility $\mu_q$ is related to its generalized mobility $\mu$ by the equation $\mu = \frac{\mu_q}{q}$. The parameter $\mu_q$ is the ratio of the particle's terminal drift velocity to an applied electric field. Hence, the equation in the case of a charged particle is given as:

    \end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vspace{0.5cm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \textbf{Energy Bands} - By conceptually bringing $N$ silicon atoms closer and closer together, the interatomic forces lead to a spread in the allowed energies which give rise to closely spaced sets of allowed states known as energy bands.  At the interatomic distance corresponding to the $Si$ lattice spacing , the distribution of allowed states consists of two bands separated by an intervening energy gap.

        \item{No current can arise from the electrons in a completely filled energy band.}

        \item{Even under equilibrium conditions, nonuniform doping will give rise to carrier concentration gradients, a built-in electric field, and non-zero current components.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{F}
    \textbf{Fermi Energy} - A concept in quantum mechanics usually referring to the energy difference between the highest and lowest occupied single-particle states in a quantum system of non-interacting fermions at absolute zero temperature.
    The term "Fermi energy" is often used to refer to a different yet closely related concept, the "Fermi level".  There are a few key differences between the Fermi level and Fermi energy:
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \vspace{0.15cm}
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \begin{itemize}
        \setlength\itemsep{0.5em}
        \item{The Fermi energy is only defined at absolute zero, while the Fermi level is defined for any temperature.}
        \item{The Fermi energy is an energy difference (usually corresponding to a kinetic energy), whereas the Fermi level is a total energy level including kinetic energy and potential energy.}
        \item{The Fermi energy can only be defined for non-interacting fermions (where the potential energy or band edge is a static, well defined quantity), whereas the Fermi level remains well defined even in complex interacting systems, at thermodynamic equilibrium.}
    \end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vspace{0.5cm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \textbf{Fermi Function} - Specifies how many of the existing states at a given energy $E$ will be filled with an electron, or equivalently, specifies, under equilibrium conditions, the probability that an available state at an energy $E$ will be occupied by an electron.
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \vspace{0.15cm}
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \begin{itemize}
        \setlength\itemsep{0.5em}
        \item{As $T \to 0K$}, all states at energies below $E_F$  will be filled, and all states at energies above $E_F$ will be empty.
        \item{For $T > 0\;K$ and $E \geq E_F + 3kT$, the Fermi function, or filled-state probability decays exponentially to zero with increasing energy; most states at energies $3kT$ or more above $E_F$ will be empty.}
        \item{For $T > 0\;K$ and $E \leq E_F - 3kT$, the probability that a given state will be \emph{empty} decays exponentially to zero with decreasing energy; most states at energies $3kT$ or more below $E_F$ will be filled.}
        \item{The Fermi Function applies \emph{only} under equilibrium conditions.}
        \item{The Fermi function is universal in the sense that it applies to all materials; insulators, metals, and semiconductors.  It is a statistical functions associated with electrons in general.}
    \end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vspace{0.5cm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \textbf{Fermi Level} - The thermodynamic work required to add one electron to a solid-state body.  When the Fermi level is positioned in the upper half of the band gap (or higher), the electron distribution greatly outweighs the hole distribution.
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \vspace{0.15cm}
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \begin{itemize}
        \setlength\itemsep{0.5em}
        \item{Under equilibrium conditions, $\frac{dE_F}{dx} = \frac{dE_F}{dy} = \frac{dE_F}{dz} = 0$; i.e. the Fermi level inside a material or a group of materials in intimate contact is invariant as a function of position.}
    \end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vspace{0.5cm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \textbf{Fermi Level Pinning} - In most real $MS-diodes$ (both $P$\emph{-type} and $N$\emph{-type}), $\Phi_B \not = \Phi_M - \chi$.  In the majority of semiconductors, surface charges tend to fix or "pin" the equilibrium Fermi level at a specific energy within the surface band gap.  Because of this pinning effect, the observed barrier height normally varies only slightly with the metal used to fabricate the diode.
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \vspace{0.15cm}
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \begin{itemize}
        \setlength\itemsep{0.5em}
        \item{There are high densities of energy states in the band gap at the metal-semiconductor interface.}
        \item{Some of these states are acceptor like, and may be neutral or negative.}
        \item{Some of these states are donor like, and may be neutral or positive.}
        \item{The net charge is zero when the Fermi level at the interface is around the middle of the silicon band gap.}
        \item{The result is that for any $\psi_M \not \approx 4.6\;V$, there is a dipole at the interface that prevents the barrier height from moving very far from around $0.7\;V$.}
    \end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vspace{0.5cm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \textbf{Flat-Band Condition} - A condition where the energy band ($E_C$ and $E_V$) of the substrate is flat at the $Si-{SiO}_2$ interface.
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \vspace{0.15cm}
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \begin{itemize}
        \setlength\itemsep{0.5em}
        \item The flat-band voltage is the difference between the Fermi levels at the two terminals:
        \begin{equation}
            V_{FB} = \psi_g - \psi_s
        \end{equation}
        Where $\psi_g$ and $\psi_s$ are the gate work function and the semiconductor work function, respectively, in volts.

        \setlength\itemsep{0.5em}
        \item{Occurs when $V_{dg}$ is large enough to create band-bending that facilitates band-to-band tunneling between the drain and the gate, because the channel/drain junction is heavily reverse-biased, which causes the barrier to be narrowed.}
