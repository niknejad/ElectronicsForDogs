\section{Chapter Preview}
In this chapter we'll be covering multi-stage amplifiers consisting of a cascade of two or more single-stage amplifiers.  First we'll be reviewing amplifier input/output impedance characteristics, which will provide insights on the best ways to cascade amplifiers.  Next, we'll start with the important common-source amplifier stage and show that while cascading these stages will result in higher gain, it comes with a severe penalty of bandwidth reduction.  To partially circumvent this bandwidth reduction, we'll see how voltage buffers can be inserted in between amplifier stages.  We'll also cover an important special case of a capacitive load, which commonly occurs for on-chip amplifiers, and how to drive these loads.  The next cascade we'll investigate in detail is the common-source amplifier cascaded with a common-gate amplifier, which is better known as the cascode amplifier.  We'll discuss this topology in detail because it plays such an important role in circuit design.  The chapter will conclude with a ``big'' example to demonstrate how a seemingly complex circuit can be simplified into simple building blocks.  Obviously this ability to see through the clutter of a circuit will not be learned overnight, but it's something you can learn fairly quickly through practice.  In many ways we'll only touch on the important concepts of multi-stage amplifiers, as the examples in this chapter are fairly simple.  But we must first learn to walk before we attempt to run.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In the past few chapters, we have discussed single stage amplifiers in detail, building models for each as either a voltage/current or hybrid amplifier (transconductance or transresistance), see Fig.~\ref{fig:ampchart_models_fig}.  Why should we need to cascade single-stage amplifier stages?  The simplest reason is to provide more gain.   More is better, right? No, not always, but in the right circumstance, distributing gain over multiple stages has benefits. Such benefits include the ability to realize higher bandwidth, or for driving output loads without compromising the gain.  By separating the task of amplification into multiple steps, such as to drive an external load, we can better optimize each stage.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
To begin, let's talk about gain.  In modern technology, the amount of realizable gain per stage is  limited, especially in nanoscale devices.  For example, in a technology with $L = 1\mathrm{\mu m}$, a single device could provide an intrinsic gain $g_m r_o \approx 100$, whereas a short channel transistor in 28nm technology may only provide a gain of 10.  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The other reason we use multiple amplifier stages is to better match the input and output source and load resistances to the amplifier.  The source or load impedance may be too high or low, and a voltage or current buffer can often provide a better interface.  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Single stage amplifiers such as common-source stages provide very high voltage gain, but suffer from low frequency poles due to the lack of isolation from the input (gate) to the output (drain), flowing through the parasitic gate-drain capacitance $C_{gd}$.  Many multi-stage amplifiers improve the bandwidth by providing better isolation.  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In other situations, an amplifier may have a high impedance node to provide large gain, and any additional capacitance on this node may be detrimental to bandwidth.  As we'll see, a buffer can decouple the high impedance nodes from large load capacitors.  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
As mentioned earlier, output stages to drive ``external" loads are often needed and usually have low gain owing to the fact that the load is a very small resistance (say a speaker or antenna).  Multiple gain stages are therefore required to isolate the load from the gain stages, and an output stage is needed to drive the load.  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Finally, more subtle applications of multi-stage amplification are for DC coupling, eliminating large passive elements such as capacitors that are needed to block the DC signal.   We can use amplifier stages to naturally ``level-shift" the signal.  Multi-stage amplifiers like differential stages (covered in the next chapter) are also naturally more immune to the absolute DC level of the signal.

\subsection{Impedance ``Match"}
On-chip circuits often use ``voltage/current" matching to minimize loading.  Voltage matching means we drive a high impedance load with a low impedance source.  Current matching is the opposite, we drive a low impedance load with a high impedance load.  This results in minimal signal attenuation.  At high frequencies, we can get even higher gain through passive element (resonant) matching gain circuits, but at lower frequencies the required values of inductance are not realizable or practical, especially on-chip.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Table~\ref{tab:imp} level is a quick summary of the impedance levels of various ideal amplifier topologies and their input and output resistance levels.   For example, consider a voltage amplifier driving a current amplifier.  Since the current amplifier input impedance is low, and the voltage amplifier also has low output impedance, the cascade will suffer from loading effects.  However, if we cascade a voltage-to-current transconductance amplifier, we can see that the output/inputs are well suited to driving/load and all is well.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:1cascade}, simply cascading two amplifier stages is possible if the DC voltage levels are compatible. In other words, the desired operating point of each individual amplifier should not change when we connect them, because otherwise, we need AC coupling capacitors.  It's best to avoid AC coupling capacitors as they take up a lot of room on the chip or PCB and they limit the range of operation (since they kill the low frequency gain).  For this reason, it's good to think of cascading amplifiers while designing them.  If we are careful to not disturb the operating points, the cascade will result in higher gain.  We can think of the overall cascade as a single two-port model.  If the amplifiers are unilateral, then the input impedance of the cascade is simply  $R_{in} = R_{in,1}$, and the output impedance of the cascade is $R_{out} = R_{out,2}$.

\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
As an example of a cascade, let's take two common-source stages in cascade.  We'd need to ensure that the drain voltage of the first stage is the right bias point for the second stage gate, but considering only the AC schematic shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:2cs_casc_ss}, the resulting new two-port DC gain can be analyzed by inspection:
    \begin{equation}
        A_v = \frac{v_{out}}{v_{in}} = -g_{m1} (r_{01}||r_{oc1}) \times  -g_{m2} (r_{02}||r_{oc2}) = g_{m1} (r_{01}||r_{oc1}) g_{m2} (r_{02}||r_{oc2})
    \end{equation}
The input impedance is just the input impedance of the first stage:
    \begin{equation}
        R_{in} = R_{in,1} = \infty\Omega 
    \end{equation} 
And the output impedance is given by the second stage:
    \begin{equation}
        R_{out} = R_{out,2} = r_{o2} || r_{oc2} 
    \end{equation}

\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The AC schematic shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:3cs_casc_ss_cap} looks complicated, with 6 capacitors shown.  But if we combine parallel components and also apply the Miller Theorem, we can identify three independent nodes.  At the input, applying Miller's theorem:
    \begin{equation} 
        C_{M1} = C_{gs1} + C_{gd1} (1 - A_{v1}) 
    \end{equation}
We can approximate the gain of the first stage:
    \begin{equation} 
        A_{v1} = -g_{m1} r_{01}||r_{oc1} 
    \end{equation}
This results in a composite capacitance of:
    \begin{equation} 
        C_{M1} = C_{gs1} + C_{gd1} (1 + g_{m1} r_{01}||r_{oc1}) 
    \end{equation}
The second stage is exactly the same, starting with the Miller capacitance:
    \begin{equation} 
        C_{M2} = C_{gs2} + C_{db1} + C_{gd2} (1 - A_{v2}) 
    \end{equation}
Approximating the gain:
    \begin{equation} 
        A_{v2} = -g_{m2} (r_{02}||r_{oc2})
    \end{equation}
Results in a second Miller composite capacitance:
    \begin{equation} 
        C_{M2} = C_{gs2} + C_{db1} + C_{gd2} (1 + g_{m2} r_{02}||r_{oc2}) 
    \end{equation}
The simplified schematic is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:4cs_casc_ss_cap_miller}.  The time constant of the input node is given by:
    \begin{equation}
        \tau_1 = C_{M1} R_s 
    \end{equation}
and the intermediate node is given by:
    \begin{equation} 
        \tau_2 = C_{M2} (r_{01} || r_{oc1}) 
    \end{equation}

\caption{Simplified small-signal schematic of a common-source cascade using the Miller approximations.} \label{fig:4cs_casc_ss_cap_miller}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Notice that $\tau_1$ depends on the source resistance $R_s$, which can be lowered to improve the bandwidth.  On the other hand,  the intermediate node is a killer because the resistance is large (output resistance of transistors) and the capacitance is large due to Miller multiplication.   The output may also contribute a pole, especially if driving a capacitive load.  Many poles results in very poor bandwidth, especially if they are all close in magnitude.  This is one of the main issues with the multi-stage common-source cascade.

\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Since the common-source stage has high gain but suffers from a low bandwidth, a follower stage can buffer the Miller cap from the high output impedance of a second transistor since it has low output impedance ($1/g_m$), as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:55cs_cd_cs_casc}.  We still need to keep $R_s$ under control.  Recall that the $C_{gs}$ of the follower stage is ``bootstrapped", and it does not load the common-source stage:
\begin{equation}
	C_M = C_{gs} (1 - A_v) \approx 0 \mathrm{F}
\end{equation}

\label{fig:5cs_cd_cs_casc_ss_miller}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\noindent As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:5cs_cd_cs_casc_ss_miller}, for the input time constant, we have (as before):   
    \begin{equation} 
        \tau_1 = (C_{gs1} + C_{gd1} (1 + g_{m1} r_{01}||r_{oc1})) R_s 
    \end{equation}
For the input of the follower, the capacitance is low because of the follower bootstrapping:
    \begin{equation} 
        \tau_2 = (C_{db1} + C_{gd2} ) r_{01}||r_{oc1} 
    \end{equation}
At the output of the buffer, the low output impedance keeps the time constant small:
    \begin{equation}  
        \tau_3 = (C_{gs3} + C_{gd3} (1 + g_{m3} r_{03}||r_{oc3}))) \frac{1}{g_{m2}} 
    \end{equation}
At the load, if there's no load capacitance, we have another relatively high frequency pole:
    \begin{equation}  
        \tau_4 = C_{db3} (r_{o3} || r_{oc3})
    \end{equation}

\label{fig:6cs_dc}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
A schematic of a common-source amplifier with biasing elements is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:6cs_dc}. Recall that $C_{\text{Large}}$ is a very large bypass capacitor.  Usually the larger these capacitors, the better, as they define the low frequency cutoff limit.  These capacitors look like short circuits to the AC signal.  On the other hand, if the load capacitance $C_L$ is large, its pole dominates. Let's analyze this scenario.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\caption{AC small-signal schematic of common-source amplifier including the effective loading by biasing elements $R_{in}$. and load capacitor $C_L$.}
\label{fig:7cs_cL_ss}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In Fig.~\ref{fig:7cs_cL_ss}, note that $R_{in}$ represents the parallel combination of the biasing resistors, $R_{in} = R_{B1} || R_{B2}$.  If we make a Miller approximation, the input time constant is given by:
    \begin{equation}
        \tau_1 = R_s || R_{in} (C_{gs} + g_m (r_o||R_D) C_{gd} )
    \end{equation}
At the output, we have a large capacitor $C_L \gg C_{gs,gd,db}$, so it dominates the time constant over the transistor parasitics:
    \begin{equation}
        \tau_2 \approx (R_D|| r_o) C_L 
    \end{equation}
What can we do if we have to drive a large $C_L$?  How can we reduce the impact of $C_L$? One way is to reduce the resistance $R_D$, but this reduces our pass-band gain.   To recover the gain we can increase $g_{m1}$, at the cost of increased power consumption.   A better way to extend the bandwidth is to add a source-follower stage, shown Fig.~\ref{fig:8_cs_cd_casc_dc}, to buffer the output load capacitor from the gain stage.  The analysis is similar to previous example.  As shown in the AC schematic in Fig.~\ref{fig:9cs_cd_casc_ss}, by adding a common-drain stage (Source Follower), we can increase the bandwidth. Even though it costs us power for the follower stage, increasing the bandwidth by increasing $g_{m1}$ costs us much more.

Consider the cascade shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:10cs_cg_cascade}.  The common-source stage provides gain, and the common-gate acts as a current buffer, passing the current to the load.  Since the current buffer stage has a gain of one, is it even helping?  On first pass, it seems like M2 is not doing anything because it just buffers the current of M1 and does not provide gain.  But understanding this topology is more subtle as it provides potential gain and bandwidth benefits.

As seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:10cascode_dc}, we can share the bias currents between the two amplifier stages by stacking them into a common structure, commonly known as a cascode.  While this circuit has reduced headroom, it can be seen as a ``supercharged" common-source stage.  We know the $g_m$ of the combined M1/M2 amplifier is the same as a single transistor, but the output impedance is boosted by the $g_m r_o$ of the transistor.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Let's apply two-port small-signal analysis, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:11cascode_ss}.  Note the common-gate stage is degenerated by M1, so $R_{s2} = r_{o1}$. In this case, we care about the \textit{input current }to the second stage. Since the input resistance of the CG is low, the majority of the CS current is fed to the CG stage.  This means the DC gain of the amplifier is given by:
    \begin{equation}
        A_v = -g_{m1} \left(R_D || (r_{02} + g_{m2}r_{o2} r_{o1}) \right) \approx -g_{m1} R_D
    \end{equation}
This is no better than a common-source stage?  Why cascode?  Well, for one you can immediately see that we are throwing away a lot of gain by using $R_D$.  If we instead use an ideal current source, the gain will rise to:
    \begin{equation}
        A_v = -g_{m1}  (r_{02} + g_{m2}r_{o2} r_{o1}) \approx - (g_m r_o)^2 
    \end{equation}
This is substantially higher than the maximum gain of a single transistor, giving credence to the ``supercharged" transistor claim.  But it's even better than that when we consider bandwidth.

To analyze the bandwidth of the cascade, let's add all the transistor parasitic capacitors, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:12cascode_caps}a.  Notice that with all the parasitic capacitors in this circuit, our first step is try to combine as many as possible.   Let's identify three key nodes in the circuit, the gate \emph{g}, the internal node at the drain of M1 labeled \emph{i}, and the output labeled \emph{o}, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:12cascode_caps}b.  Next we can apply Miller to get a sense for the bandwidth limiting stages.  We immediately notice a difference in the Miller capacitance.  For M2, its $C_{gd}$ is simply grounded, and it's not Miller multiplied.  On the other hand, for M1, the Miller capacitance is ``shielded" from the high voltage gain at the output node.  We will also show that the voltage gain experienced at the intermediate node is much lower.

\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
For a complete analysis of the bandwidth of the cascode amplifier, let's examine the small-signal model, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:14cascode_ac_ss}.  Notice that we take advantage of the equivalent two-port circuit model of the common-gate stage.   At the input node, $C_{gd1}$ is Miller multiplied like a common-source but we need to find the voltage gain from the gate to the drain of M1, which is given by
    \begin{equation}
        A_{vi} = \frac{v_i}{v_g} = -g_{m1} \left( r_{o1} || \frac{1}{g_{m2}} \right) \approx \frac{-g_{m1}}{g_{m2}}
    \end{equation}
Since M1 and M2 share the same current, if they are sized equally, the internal voltage gain is simply $A_{vi} = -1$, so the Miller multiplication is small:
    \begin{equation}
        \tau_g = R_{s} (C_{gs1} + 2 C_{gd1})
    \end{equation}
The intermediate node is a wide bandwidth node because the common-gate amplifier has a low input impedance of $1/g_{m2}$:
    \begin{equation}
        \tau_i = C_i \left(\frac{1}{g_{m2}} || r_{o1}  \right) \approx \frac{C_i}{g_{m2}}
    \end{equation}  
Finally, the output node bandwidth depends on the load and $R_D$:
    \begin{equation}
        \tau_o = C_o (R_D || (r_{02} + g_{m2}r_{o2} r_{o1})) \approx R_D C_o
    \end{equation}
We now can appreciate the benefits of the cascode amplifier.  It's essentially a supercharged transistor with the same $g_m$ but it doesn't suffer from the Miller effect (as much) and the achievable gain is much higher.  For this reason, the cascode is a workhorse gain stage used in many amplifiers.  The only down side is the reduced voltage headroom, discussed in the next section.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
As discussed previously, the output impedance of the cascode is very high, and loading it with $R_D$ is likely to reduce the voltage gain.  The best we can do is to use a current source load, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:15cascode_current_source_dc}, but $r_{oc}$ needs to be very large. Thus we should use a cascode current mirror load.

\subsection{Example:  Complete Amplifier Design}
Let's design a complete cascode amplifier with the following goal of achieving a DC gain magnitude of 5000.   Let's choose $g_{m1} = 1$mS.\footnote{We will learn in the chapter on op-amps that a given value of $g_m$ is needed for the transconductnace stage to meet bandwidth specifications.} For simplicity, let's assume all the $g_m$ and $r_o$ values are equal.  Since the gain is given by
    \begin{equation} 
        {A_v} \approx  - {g_{m1}}{R_{out}} =  - 1\mathrm{mS} \cdot 5\mathrm{M}\Omega  =  - 5,000 
    \end{equation}
The required output resistance is given by:
    \begin{equation} 
        {R_{out}} \approx \frac{1}{2}{g_m}r_o^2 = 5\mathrm{M\Omega} 
    \end{equation}
The factor of half accounts for the parallel combination of the NMOS and PMOS cascode stages, one for the cascode amplifier the other the cascode mirror load.  That means each transistor needs an output resistance $r_o$ of:
    \begin{equation} 
        {r_o} = \sqrt {\frac{{20\mathrm{M}\Omega }}{{{g_m}}}}  = \sqrt {\frac{{10\mathrm{M}\Omega }}{{1\mathrm{mS}}}}  = 100\mathrm{k}\Omega 
    \end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Bias Current and Device Sizing}
To complete the design, we need to know process parameters to solve for $W/L$.  We are given the following technology parameters: $k = 100 \mu A/V^2$ and $\lambda = .1V^{-1}$
With knowledge of these parameters, we can calculate the DC current: 
    \begin{equation} 
        {r_o} = \frac{1}{{\lambda {I_{DS}}}} = 100\mathrm{k}\Omega 
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation} 
        {I_{DS}} = \frac{1}{{.1{V^{ - 1}} 100\mathrm{k}\Omega }} = 100\mu \mathrm{A}
    \end{equation}
Since we have specified the $g_m$, we can now find the device size $W/L$:
    \begin{equation} 
        {g_m} = \sqrt {2k'\left( {\frac{W}{L}} \right){I_{DS}}}  = 1\mathrm{mS} 
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation} 
        \frac{W}{L} = \frac{{g_m^2}}{{2k'{I_{DS}}}} = \frac{{{{(1\mathrm{mS})}^2}}}{{2 \cdot 100\mu \cdot 100\mu \mathrm{A}}} = 50 
    \end{equation}
You may question our selection of $g_m$ which implies the DC current and device dimensions.  The reason we pre-selected $g_m$ is related to the fact that we desire a certain gain bandwidth in amplifiers, a topic which we'll cover when we discuss op-amps.  For now, simply accept it as a given that amplifiers need a minimum $g_m$ in certain cases to meet specifications that we have not discussed.

\subsubsection{Output (Voltage) Swing}
The biggest downside to this enormous cascode amplifier is the low voltage swing.  Recall that each transistor operates with a certain over-drive voltage related to the current:
    \begin{equation}
        V_{od} = V_T + \sqrt{\frac{2 I_{DS}}{\mu C_{ox} \frac{W}{L}}} 
    \end{equation}
also known as the $V_{dsat}$ of a transistor.  For our example:
    \begin{equation} 
        {g_m} = \frac{{2{I_{DS}}}}{{{V_{GS}} - {V_T}}} = 1\mathrm{mS} 
    \end{equation}
and so
    \begin{equation}
        {V_{GS}} - {V_T} = \frac{{2{I_{DS}}}}{{{g_m}}} = \frac{{2 \cdot100\mu \mathrm{A}}}{{1\mathrm{mS}}} = 0.2\mathrm{V} 
    \end{equation}
For long channel devices, this is simply $V_{GS} - V_T$.  To keep all devices in saturation, we have to ensure that the voltage levels don't exceed the following limits:
    \begin{equation}
        V_{o} < V_{DD} - 2 V_{od}
    \end{equation} 
and
    \begin{equation}
        V_{o} >  2 V_{od}
    \end{equation} 
That means that the minimum supply voltage is $V_{swing} + 0.2\mathrm{V} \cdot 4 = 0.8\mathrm{V} + V_{swing}$.  For example, for a 0.4V swing, we need at least 1.2V.  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
One issue we have been avoiding is how we would actually deliver all the bias voltages shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:15cascode_current_source_dc}b.  The input transistor needs a bias to establish the current, but we need to ensure this current matches the top PMOS transistor.  This is in fact the major problem with this circuit because the cascode M1 will ``fight" the cascode current mirror load M4 to establish the current, resulting in an undetermined DC output level.  In practice we need a feedback circuit to establish a well defined output voltage that does not vary with temperature, process, and supply voltage; in other words we need to program the gate voltage of M4 (labeled bias$_1$) to achieve the desired output DC level (say mid-rail).

Let's end this chapter by bringing together all the various concepts to analyze a ``big" circuit, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:16cascode_folded}.  At first it looks intimidating, but we'll solve this problem one step at a time.

\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The key to analyzing a big circuit is to cut out all the clutter.  To do this, identify the ``signal path" between the input and output and aggressively eliminate ``background" transistors to reduce the clutter, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:17cascode_folded_declutter}.  Transistors M5-M8 are all diode connected and essentially provide DC levels to bias up the other transistors.  So we simply ignore them for the AC analysis.  For these ``background" transistors, we need to understand their role (e.g. DC biasing) and model them appropriately.  If they are just providing DC voltages, we can assume that these connections are AC grounds.  Later, for estimating the frequency response, we need identify ``high-Z" (high impedance) nodes, so keep these in mind as we traverse the circuit.

\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In the schematic of Fig.~\ref{fig:17cascode_folded_declutter}, notice that M1 and M4 are biased with constant gate-source voltage and only play an indirect role as far as the signal is concerned.  We can in fact model them as current sources and simplify the schematic further, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:18cascode_folded_dc}.

\caption{AC schematic of the core amplifier consists of transistors M2/M3, known as a ``folded cascode" amplifier.}
\label{fig:19cascode_folded_ac}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Since M1 and M4 are providing DC currents, as far as the AC circuit is concerned they are open-circuits, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:19cascode_folded_ac}.  With all these simplifications we finally can see the essence of the circuit. It's simply an NMOS common-source stage followed by a PMOS common-gate stage.  It's like a cascode, except it's ``folded down", and aptly named the ``folded cascode".  M1 provides the required DC bias for both M2 and M3.  Since M4 establishes the current in M3, the difference between the current of M1 and M4 flows into M2.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Why is the cascode folded?  Compared with a regular cascode, the second stage moves the DC bias voltage down, which may be required to drive another stage.  Furthermore, by folding the cascode, the voltage headroom requirements are reduced.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Now let's put the circuit under the microscope to see if we missed anything.  Notice that in Fig.~\ref{fig:16cascode_folded}, there's actually a current divider that we neglected.  The AC current generated by M2 is divided between M3, M2 ($r_o$) and M1.  We tacitly assumed that M3 has a much higher input conductance (approximately $g_m$) compared to the output conductance of M1, which is $1/r_{o1}$, and so we pretty much neglected the AC current flow into M1.  Similarly, we lose a small amount of current into the output resistance of M2, which we ignored.  The only time we need to be careful about this approximation is when the load $R_L$ becomes very large, invalidating our assumption that the input impedance of M3 is $1/g_m$.  Also, if you were wondering, since M1 is not diode connected, its current is not mirrored to M5, even though they have the same $v_{gs}$.  Taking this all into consideration, the gain of the amplifier is given by
    \begin{equation}
        A_v = - g_{m2} \frac{g_{m3}}{g_{m3} + 1/r_{o1} + 1/r_{o2}} R_L || r_{o4} || (1 + g_{m3} r_{o1}||r_{o2}) r_{o3} \approx -g_{m2} R_L
    \end{equation} 
If the above equation is ``obvious" to you, you've made it.  You can now analyze multi-stage amplifiers by ``inspection".  If not, don't worry, it takes some practice.

%
% 
%\begin{equation}
%	A_v \approx -g_m R_L = \frac{2 I_D}{V_{GS}-V_T} R_L
%\end{equation} 
%
% Say $V_{GS} - V_T = 0.2$V.  Then $I_D > 12.5$mA for unity gain.
% Follower is natural choice, but it can only “source” current (think in terms of large signals).
% For the case of the CD output stage, if we design set $I_{D2}$ of the follower to  12.5mA, then the output resistance $1/g_{m2}$ would give a gain of 0.5 for the output stage, but a \emph{much} larger gain can be realized on the CS stage, an overall win.

% Is there a more robust way to do this without using inductors and capacitors ?  Yes !  We'll see that differential amplifiers have much more flexibility.
