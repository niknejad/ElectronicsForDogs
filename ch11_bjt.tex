\section{Chapter Preview}
Historically, the first transistor conceived was the MOS device, but the first successful transistor to be built and tested was the bipolar junction transistor, or BJT for short.  In fact, the photo shown in the previous chapter (\emph{Fig.~\ref{fig:bjt_invent}}) was that very transistor.  While the CMOS transistors reign supreme in terms of digital logic circuits, offering much lower power and higher density compared to their BJT logic circuit counterparts, BJT transistors continue to play an important role in many applications.  For one, they generally have better current handling capability as currents flow through the bulk of the device, as opposed to the surface of an MOS transistor.  BJT transistors are also faster in the same lithographic technology node, with the fastest transistors crossing the $1\,THz$ frequency, about 2-3 times faster than CMOS counterparts.  But even if you anticipate spending your entire life designing CMOS circuits, there is a good reason to understand bipolar transistor device physics.  First and foremost, it is a very interesting device to study with a voltage-current mechanism that is very different from the CMOS transistor.  In fact, it is very much a close cousin of the $PN$-junction diode.  Second, every CMOS device has a BJT inside of it, like it or not.  For low gate voltages, or the so-called sub-threshold region, the BJT dominates and determines the currents.  

In this chapter we start with a physical description of the device structure, and then move on to derive the $I$-$V$ characteristics, building on our knowledge of $PN$-junctions. We shall strive to understand the behavior in two ways.  First, we will not use any equations, but instead build from our physical understanding of the $PN$-junction.  Then we will move on to using equations.  We will see that like a MOS device, there is one terminal, the "base", that is "in control" of the current flowing between the other terminals (called the "gate" for MOS).  Similar to "source" and "drain", a bipolar transistor has an "emitter" and a "collector".
We will conclude the chapter with circuit models of the bipolar transistor, including a "Large Signal" Ebers-Moll model, and then a small-signal model.  The small-signal model for a BJT is actually very close to the MOS small-signal model, enabling us to re-use a lot of our background intuition.

\subsection{Ideal BJT Structure}
The structure of a BJT transistor is deceptively simple.  It is just either an $NPN$ sandwich, or a $PNP$ sandwich, as shown in \emph{Fig.~\ref{fig:slide2_bjt_overview}}.  Each region is a doped semiconductor, either $N$-type or $P$-type.  The middle part is the \textbf{Base}\index{BJT!terminals!base} (B), and in an $NPN$ transistor (similar to NMOS), it's doped $P$-type.  Usually a bias voltage is applied across the $NPN$ transistor terminals in such a manner such that the top is at a positive voltage, and the bottom at a lower voltage, sometimes ground.  The bottom is known as the \textbf{Emitter}\index{BJT!terminals!emitter} (E), as it emits electrons into the base.  The electrons are "collected" at the \textbf{Collector}\index{BJT!terminals!collector} (C), at the top terminal.  So the current into the collector ideally flows out of the emitter, similar to a MOS device.

But how does current flow at all, since the structure is two back-to-back diodes, pointing in opposite directions?  One diode says "one way" North and the other says "one way" South!  The two junctions cannot be simultaneously forward biased if the collector is at a high voltage relative to the base, which is the normal \textbf{operating point}\index{BJT!operating point} for the transistor.

The solution lies in making the base very thin so that as minority carriers diffuse across the base from a forward biased \textbf{base-emitter junction}, they quickly reach the \textbf{base-collector junction}\index{BJT!junctions}, where they are swept into collector due to the fields from the reverse biased junction, providing a pathway for current to flow.  In a well designed transistor, most of the emitter electron current flows into the collector and not the base, so:
    \begin{equation}
        I_C \approx -I_E
    \end{equation}
This means that the base current is very small:
    \begin{equation}
        I_C \gg I_B
    \end{equation}
Because the collector current is a forward-biased diode current of the base-emitter, it has the following form:
    \begin{align}
        \Aboxed{I_C &\approx I_S \cdot e^{\mathlarger{\frac{q\,V_{BE}}{kT}}}} &\textit{BJT collector current}
    \end{align}
This behavior is very much a like a "transistor", because the current through the collector is a function of another terminal-pair, namely the base-emitter.  Thus, the BJT device is a \textbf{voltage-controlled current source} (VCCS)\index{Voltage-controlled current source}, just like the MOS transistor.

\subsection{Actual BJT Cross-Section}
A real transistor is actually fabricated using a \textbf{crystalline}\index{Crystalline} substrate, with various layers grown using diffusion regions and counter-doping.  A typical \textbf{"vertical" BJT}\index{BJT!vertical fabrication} is shown in \emph{Fig.~\ref{fig:slide3_bjtcross}}.  This is a complicated figure so let's dissect it piece by piece.  First, focus in on the dashed box.  This is the "active region" where the transistor actually resides.  This region is very much like the $NPN$ sandwich of an ideal structure.  The collector is the bottom $N$-type region, the middle region is a $P$-type base, and the top is made of an $N$-type emitter.  Notice that each layer is doped and so the concentration of dopants necessarily increases from the bottom to the top. The emitter is the most heavily doped, and the collector is the lightest doping. The base is in the middle in terms of doping.  This order, collector, then base, and then emitter is chosen for a good reason.  Due to symmetry, an $N^+PN$ transistor can be viewed as an upside down transistor with $NPN^+$.  However, due to the difference in doping levels, this upside down transistor is not a good transistor, which we will see shortly.

Transistors can also be fabricated laterally, similar to NMOS and PMOS devices.  In fact, if you examine the cross-section of a MOS device, such as \emph{Fig.~\ref{fig:mos_bjt}}, it actually has a couple of BJT's hiding in there!  Even though the gate couples capacitively to the channel, it can indirectly act like a base terminal.  These \textbf{"lateral" BJTs}\index{BJT!lateral fabrication} tend to have inferior performance because the base width is determined lithographically rather than due to diffusion. One advantage of the BJT structure is in fact the ability to make very thin bases without using lithography.  In the early days this was critical for good device performance.

Everything else in the cross-section of the BJT is actually just there to support the device.  The $n^+$ buried layer is a low resistance contact to the collector, and the $p^+$ region under the base contact serves the same purpose.  The emitter is contacted using a highly doped polysilicon film. In fact, film can be used as the emitter itself.

\subsection{BJT Layout}
Let's now view the layout from the top\index{BJT!top-view layout}, as shown in \emph{Fig.~\ref{fig:bjt_top}a}.  This is a unit cell that can grow in width as shown, similar to how we can scale a MOSFET.  The emitter area is the most relevant transistor parameter, because the transistor current is injected from the emitter to the base.  The base and collector can also form rings around the device to lower the \textbf{parasitic resistance}\index{BJT!parasitic resistance} (\emph{Fig.~\ref{fig:bjt_top}b}).  Although it is not shown in this figure, a multi-finger layout strategy can be used to obtain lower parasitic resistances to the collector and base.

\subsection{BJT Schematic Symbol}
The schematic shown in \emph{Fig.~\ref{fig:slide5_bjt_schematic}} is for an $NPN$ device.  The symbol looks a lot like the MOSFET, and the arrow is in the direction of the base-emitter diode.  As already noted, the device looks symmetric.  But unlike a MOSFET, the collector and emitter cannot be swapped, because of the difference in the doping profiles. In fact, when the BJT is operated in this inverted fashion, it is in the \textbf{"reverse active" regime}\index{BJT!regions of operation!reverse active}.  In this region the performance is much worse, as we shall explain shortly.

\section{Observed \texorpdfstring{$I-V$}{I-V} Characteristics}
In this section we will show typical \textbf{I-V curves}\index{BJT!$I$-$V$ curves} of a BJT transistor, both in terms of a voltage control device and in terms of a current control device.  The first set of curves are similar to a MOSFET.  But since only a bipolar transistor has a base current, the second perspective is new.  One finds experimentally that the following equations describe the behavior of the device:
    \begin{align}
        \Aboxed{I_C &= \beta_F\,I_B} &\textit{Collector amplification factor}\\[0.5cm]
        \Aboxed{I_C &\approx I_S\,e^{\mathlarger{\frac{q\,V_{BE}}{kT}}}} &\textit{Collector current as a function of emitter voltage}
    \end{align}
These equations\index{BJT!Collector amplification factor}\index{BJT!Collector current} show that the collector current is an amplified copy of the base current.  Alternatively, in terms of voltages, the collector current is an exponential function of the base-emitter voltage.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Base-Emitter Voltage Control}
First let's observe the BJT device using voltage control on the \textbf{base-emitter junction}\index{BJT!junctions!base-emitter junction}, as shown in the inset of \emph{Fig.~\ref{fig:slide8_bjt_ic_vs_ve_curves}}.  For a fixed $V_{BE}$, we sweep the collector-emitter voltage $V_{CE}$ to generate a $I_C$-$V_{CE}$ curve, and we observe that the current is approximately flat for a fixed value of $V_{BE}$.  As we increase $V_{BE}$ in discrete steps, we observe a \textbf{family of curves}\index{BJT!family of curves}.  The collector current increases exponentially as we increase the base-emitter voltage linearly.  This is the diode $I$-$V$ curve we have met before.  There is something special and curious about the operation of a BJT.  The transistor is a diode between the base-emitter, but the current can be collected at the collector, rather than the base.

\subsection{Collector Characteristics \texorpdfstring{(Sweep $I_B$)}{}}
Now let's view the device as a current controlled device by grounding the emitter and applying a DC voltage $V_{CE}$.  Next we drive the base with a current, $I_B$, and observe the collector current $I_C$.  The setup is shown in the inset of \emph{Fig.~\ref{fig:slide7_bjt_ic_vs_ib_curves}}, where we observe that in the \textbf{"forward active" regime}\index{BJT!regions of operation!reverse active}, the BJT acts like a \textbf{current-controlled current source} (CCCS)\index{Current-controlled current source}, with the collector current being a much larger scaled copy of the base current.  This behavior is observed over a large range of $V_{CE}$, but \textit{if the collector voltage is dropped below a certain threshold, the device no longer behaves as a current source}, and the collector current drops rapidly.  What is happening is that in this region the \textbf{collector-base junction}\index{BJT!junctions!collector-base junction} is becoming forward biased, and the device is no longer acting like a proper transistor. If the voltage is biased negatively, we enter the \emph{reverse active} region as discussed above.

The key observation is that unlike a MOS device, the BJT has a base current, because the base is not insulated from the transistor like the gate of a MOSFET.  However, in a well designed transistor, this base current is a small fraction of the collector/emitter current.  Also, because of this base current and KCL, the collector and emitter currents cannot be identical, but they are nearly so.

Now we must address a very confusing point about the nomenclature.  In a MOSFET, the forward-active region is also known as the \emph{saturation} region.  In a BJT, the region of low $V_{CE}$ is known as the \emph{saturation region}\index{BJT!saturation}.  This is very confusing but it is common practice.

Finally, all transistors have a maximum voltage that you can apply across the collector-emitter before they experience breakdown, or high currents.  The same behavior is observed in MOS devices.

\subsection{Transistor Action}
How does a BJT transistor work its magic?  First let's assume that the transistor is in the forward active region.  This means that the base-emitter junction is forward-biased, and the collector-base junction is reverse-biased with respect to the base, or the collector is at a higher voltage than the base.

Remember that the base-emitter junction is a $PN$-junction.  This means that in forward-bias it will inject electrons into the base due to diffusion, and likewise the base will inject holes into the emitter.  This is shown schematically in \emph{Fig.~\ref{fig:slide9_bjt_action}}.  Note that the "electron arrow" is larger than the "hole arrow" because the emitter is heavily doped compared to the base.  Now electrons in the base region that were injected from the emitter region can meet one of two fates.  They can either cross the base junction and be swept into the collector, or they might recombine with a hole in the base.  If the base width is much smaller than the diffusion length of minority carriers in the base, then it is more likely for the electrons to reach the collector, where they are collected, forming the collector current $I_C$.  If most of the emitted electrons are collected in this fashion, $I_C \approx I_E$. 

The base current consists of the two portions.  The hole current injected into the emitter, and the hole current to support the unlucky but rare electron-hole recombination.

\subsection{Diffusion Currents}
A plot of the minority carriers in the various regions of a bipolar transistor are shown in \emph{Fig.~\ref{fig:slide10_minority_carriers}}.  The largest contribution to current is the minority carrier current in the base.  In other words, the largest contribution is the electrons injected from the emitter.  Also shown is the low concentration of holes in the emitter.  Once electrons are collected they are no longer minority carriers, and this is why the minority carrier concentration in the collector is not shown.  Here we are interested in gradients in the minority carrier concentration.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%             SUBSECTION 11.4.3            %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{BJT Currents}
As we have noted, the collector current is nearly identical to the (magnitude) of the emitter current:
    \begin{equation}
        I_C = -\alpha_F\,I_E
        \label{eq:current_collector_emitter}
    \end{equation}
The factor $\alpha_F$ in \emph{Eq.~\ref{eq:current_collector_emitter}} is a measure of the number of emitted electrons that are collected.  For example, if only 1 in a 1000 recombines in the base, we could say:
    \begin{equation}
        \alpha _F \sim .999
    \end{equation}
But by Kirchhoff's Law, for steady currents the sum of the currents into a transistor must sum to zero:
    \begin{equation} 
        -I_E = I_C + I_B
    \end{equation}
Using the relation between the emitter and collector currents, we have:
    \begin{equation}
        I_C = -\alpha_F\,I_E = \alpha_F\,\big(I_B + I_C\big)
        \label{eq:current_relation}
    \end{equation}
\emph{Eq.~\ref{eq:current_relation}} allows us to find the \textbf{DC current gain}, or the $\beta_F$ of a transistor:
    \begin{align}
        \Aboxed{I_C &= \left(\frac{\alpha_F}{1 - \alpha_F}\right)I_B = \beta_F\,I_B} &\textit{BJT DC current gain}
    \end{align}
Using values from our earlier calculation, we have:
    \begin{equation}
        \beta_F = \left(\frac{\alpha_F}{1 - \alpha_F}\right) = \frac{.999}{.001} = 999
    \end{equation}
A good transistor is characterized by a \textit{high value} of $\beta_F$.  In real transistors an absolute value of $\beta_F$ is never stated because it varies from device to device.  Instead, a range of values are given.  A typical $\beta_F =200$ is a good value to keep in mind. \emph{Never} design a circuit that relies on a particular value of $\beta_F$.  

Electrons lost to recombination result in an exponentially decaying minority carrier profile, shown in \emph{Fig.~\ref{fig:slide12_alpha_f}}.  So the base current consists of both the recombination current, and the forward-biased injection of holes into the emitter.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Collector Current}
If you spent a great deal of time understanding the $PN$-junction device physics, it's about to pay off, because all of the equations apply to the BJT.  The forward-biased base-emitter junction results in a large diffusion of electrons across base:
    \begin{equation}
        J_{n_{diff}} = q\,D_n\frac{d{n_p}}{dx}
        = \left( \frac{q\,D_n\,n_{p,B_0}}{W_B} \right) e^{\frac{q\,V_{BE}}{kT}}
    \end{equation}
Let's define the \textbf{saturation current}\index{BJT!collector saturation current} as:
    \begin{align}
        \Aboxed{I_S &= \left(\frac{q\,D_n\,n_{p,B_0}\,A_E}{W_B}\right)} &\textit{Collector saturation current}
        \label{eq:collector_saturation}
    \end{align}
\emph{Eq.~\ref{eq:collector_saturation}} allows us to write the \textbf{collector current}\index{BJT!collector current} form we have already seen multiple times in this chapter:
    \begin{align}
        \Aboxed{I_C &= I_S\,e^{\mathlarger{\frac{q\,V_{BE}}{kT}}}} &\textit{Collector current}
    \end{align}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%             SUBSECTION 11.5.2            %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Base Current}
Because the base-emitter is forward-biased, there is also a diffusion of holes into the emitter:
    \begin{equation}
        J_{p_{diff}} = -q\,D_p\frac{d{p_n}}{dx}
        = \bigg({q\,D_p\,p_{n,E_0}}{W_E}\bigg) \left(e^{\frac{q\,V_{BE}}{kT}} - 1\right)
    \end{equation}
Because all the holes arise from the base region, the \textbf{base current}\index{BJT!base current} is responsible for this component:
    \begin{align}
        \Aboxed{I_B &= \bigg(\frac{q\,D_p\,p_{n,E_0}\,A_E}{W_E}\bigg) \left(e^{\frac{q\,V_{BE}}{kT}} - 1\right)}

    \begin{align}
        \Aboxed{\beta _F &= \frac{I_C}{I_B}
        = \frac{\left(\frac{q\,D_n\,n_{p,B_0}\,A_E}{W_B}\right)}{\left(\frac{q\,D_p\,p_{n,E_0}\,A_E}{W_E}\right)}
        = \left(\frac{D_n}{D_p}\right) \left(\frac{n_{p,B_0}}{p_{n,E_0}}\right) \left(\frac{W_E}{W_B} \right)}
        &\textit{Current gain}
        \label{eq:forward_active_current_gain}
    \end{align}
Recall that we wish to maximize this term.  We can relate the minority carrier concentrations in the base and emitter to the doping concentrations:
    \begin{equation}
        \left(\frac{n_{p,B_0}}{p_{n,E_0}}\right)
        = \frac{\frac{{n_i}^2} {N_{A,B}}} {\frac{{n_i}^2} {N_{D,E}}}
        = \frac{N_{D,E}}{N_{A,B}}
    \end{equation}
These equations tell us how to maximize the performance\index{BJT!maximizing performance} of the transistor.  We must dope the emitter as high as possible relative to the base, and the base width should be made as small as possible.  The physical reasons are clear and have already been discussed.  To recap, a short base width results in a high fraction of minority carriers flowing from the emitter to the collector.  A higher emitter doping results in more electron injection (diffusion) from the emitter side rather than hole injection (diffusion) from the base side, which also results in a relatively larger current $I_C$ compared to $I_B$.

\subsection{Ebers-Moll Model}
We can now use some symmetry arguments and include both reverse and forward-biased diode currents into the collector and emitter.   Recall that $\alpha_F$ represents the fraction of emitter carriers that reach the collector.  Likewise, when the transistor is biased in reverse active mode\index{BJT!regions of operation!reverse active}, $\alpha_R$ represents the fraction of injected carriers "collected" at the emitter side.  Combining these equations results in the \textbf{Ebers-Moll equations}\index{BJT!Ebers-Moll equations}.  The first equation is the emitter current:
    \begin{equation}
        I_E = -I_{ES} \left(e^{q\,V_{BE}/kT} - 1\right) + \alpha_R\,I_{CS}\left(e^{q\,V_{BC}/kT} - 1\right)
        \label{eq:ebers_moll_eq1}
    \end{equation}
The first term on the RHS of \emph{Eq.~\ref{eq:ebers_moll_eq1}} is the emitter diode current previously discussed, with the reverse minority carrier current included.  The current is negative because the diode is forward biased.  The second term is simply the reverse active current.  $\alpha_R$ represents the fraction of carriers that reach the emitter (rather than recombining), and is only significant if $V_{BC}$ is forward biased.

Under normal conditions, $V_{BC}$ is negative and the second term contributes only a small amount of current.  Likewise, for the collector, we have the following symmetric relations:
    \begin{equation}
        I_C = \alpha_f\,I_{ES} \left(e^{q\,V_{BE}/kT} - 1\right) - I_{CS}\left(e^{q\,V_{BC}/kT} - 1\right)
        \label{eq:ebers_moll_eq2}
    \end{equation}
It can be shown that the forward active and reverse active regions have a reciprocity relationship that dictates:
    \begin{equation}
        \alpha_F\,I_{ES} = \alpha_,I_{CS}
    \end{equation}

\subsection{Ebers-Moll Equivalent Circuit}
The \textbf{Ebers-Moll model}\index{BJT!Ebers-Moll model} is shown in \emph{Fig.~\ref{fig:slide17_ebers_moll}}.  It is a physical model of the Ebers-Moll equations, which are large-signal relations between the BJT transistor junction voltages and the resulting currents.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Note that each junction is represented by a diode: the forward diode $I_F$, and the reverse diode $I_R$.  When current flows through $I_F$, a fraction $\alpha_F I_F$ flows into the collector by the action of the controlled current source.  This is the normal forward active region. The base current is the difference current, and the reverse-biased diode current flows through $I_R$.  Take note that he model is completely symmetric.  This means that if we interchange the role of the collector and emitter, the same physics should apply, but the currents will be different.

\subsection{Forward Active Region and the Early Effect}
We can simplify the equivalent circuit model in the forward active region by noting that $I_R$ carries very little current, since if the $BC$-junction is reverse-biased, $I_R$ is very small and can be neglected.  So we can practically neglect $I_R$ and the controlled source that depends on it, resulting in the simpler model shown in \emph{Fig.~\ref{fig:slide18_ebers_moll_approx}}.  With this approximation, we can write the collector current as:
    \begin{equation}
        I_C = \alpha_F\,I_{ES} \left(e^{q\,V_{BE}/kT} - 1\right)
    \end{equation}
In practice this equation is modified to account for the non-zero output conductance of the device:
    \begin{equation}
        I_C = \alpha_F\,I_{ES} \left(e^{q\,V_{BE}/kT} - 1\right) \left(1 + \frac{V_{CE}}{V_A}\right)
        \label{ebers_moll_output_conductance}
    \end{equation}
In \emph{Eq.~\ref{eq:ebers_moll_eq1}}, $V_A$ is known as the \textbf{Early Voltage}\index{Early voltage}, as introduced in Section~\ref{sec:mos_clm}.  In the MOSFET, increasing the drain-source voltage in saturation resulted in a larger depletion region width on the drain side, and this made the channel effectively shorter.  In a BJT, we have a similar effect in that an increase in collector-emitter voltage results in a larger depletion region width on the base-collector junction.  This shortens the base width, thereby increasing the current.

\subsection{Simplified Ebers-Moll}
Even simpler Ebers-Moll models\index{BJT!simplified Ebers-Moll model} are shown in \emph{Fig.~\ref{fig:slide19}}. The forward biased diode is treated as a battery with on-voltage of about 0.7V, and the collector current is simply an amplified version of the base current.  The model degenerates into two voltage sources in saturation, as both junctions are forward biased, with $V_{CE,sat}$ given by the difference between the diode on-voltages, shown in \emph{Fig.~\ref{fig:slide19}b}.

\subsection{Small-Signal Model}
The Ebers-Moll models are useful for DC calculations.  For most AC circuits, we make use of the equivalent circuit model, known as the hybrid-$\pi$ model, shown in \emph{Fig.~\ref{fig:bjt_hybridpi}}.  The model is very similar to the small-signal model of 3-terminal MOSFET, with one notable exception.  There is a resistance $R_\pi$ between the base and emitter because unlike a MOSFET, there's a current path for the base current.

\noindent
It is not very difficult to show that the transconductance of the transistor is given by:
    \begin{equation}
        g_m = \frac{\partial I_C}{\partial V_{BE}} \bigg\rvert_Q = \frac{q\,I_C}{kT}
    \end{equation}
The transconductance here is interesting compared to that of a MOSFET.  For the MOSFET we showed (see \emph{Eq.~\ref{eq:gm_vstar}}):
    \begin{equation}
        g_{m,MOSFET} = \frac{2\,I_D}{V_{GS} - V_T}
    \end{equation}
For a fixed bias current $I_C = I_D$, the transconductance of a BJT is generally much higher than a MOSFET.  This is because when biased in strong inversion, $V_{GS} - V_T \gg kT/q$.  Recall that $kT/q$ is about $26\,mV$ at room temperature, and MOS devices in strong inversion are biased with several $100's$ of $mV$ of overdrive.  In fact, if we try to reduce $V_{GS} - V_T$ to boost the transconductance, we are in fact biasing a MOS device as a BJT!  The trade-off is that the CMOS device is much slower in sub-threshold region.  This is why it is important to understand BJT device physics, even in a CMOS world.  The transistor \textbf{base resistance}\index{BJT!base resistance} $R_\pi$ is given by:
    \begin{equation}
        R_\pi^{-1} = \frac{\partial I_B}{\partial V_{BE}} \bigg\rvert_Q
        = \left( \frac{1}{\beta_F} \right) \frac{\partial I_C}{\partial V_{BE}} \bigg\rvert_Q
        = \frac{g_m}{\beta_F}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{align}
        \Aboxed{R_\pi &= \frac{\beta_F}{g_m}} &\textit{BJT base resistance}
        \label{eq:bjt_base_resistance}
    \end{align}
This makes sense because the base current is $\beta_F$ times smaller than the collector current.  The resistor, $r_o$, models the device \textbf{output resistance}\index{BJT!output resistance}: 
    \begin{equation}
        r_o^{-1} = \left. \frac{\partial I_C}{\partial V_{CE}} \right|_Q  = \frac{I_C}{V_A}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{align}
        \Aboxed{r_o &= \frac{V_A}{I_C}} &\textit{BJT output resistance}
        \label{eq:bjt_output_resistance}
    \end{align}
Since the base-emitter and base-collector are $PN$-junctions, there is an associated \textbf{junction capacitance}\index{BJT!junction capacitances}.  In the forward active region, $C_{\mu} = C_{j,bc}(V_{BC})$ is the \textbf{base-collector reverse biased junction capacitance}.  Likewise $C_\pi$ contains the forward-biased junction capacitance, but also models the minority charge storage effects we discussed when we analyzed the diode, see Section~\ref{sec:charge_storage}:
    \begin{equation}
        C_\pi \approx 1.4\,C_{j,be_0} + C_{diff}
        \label{eq:bjt_junction_capacitance}
    \end{equation}
In \emph{Eq.~\ref{eq:bjt_junction_capacitance}}, the factor of $1.4$ models the increase in junction capacitance under forward bias.  The \textbf{diffusion capacitance} is given by a similar expression we presented for a diode:
    \begin{equation}
        C_{diff} = g_m\,\tau_F
        \label{eq:bjt_diffusion_capacitance}
    \end{equation}
The factor $\tau_F$ is a technology parameter known as the \textbf{"forward transit time"}\index{BJT!forward transit time}.  It is essentially the time it takes a minority carrier to cross the various regions and junction.  The physical reason for this is that charge is stored in the base due to the minority carrier diffusion profile in the base.  If the base current is increased, it takes a finite amount of time to build a new diffusion profile, a time that corresponds to how long it takes for minority carriers to flow into the base.
